BEE 361 Environmental Monitoring Lab: make and calibrate a sensor.

The purpose of this lab is to introduce a sensor calibration.  This is the way in which we link measurable signals to the variable of interest.  Today, you will build and calibrate your own temperature sensor.

.

You might use hot liquids for this lab, use care when pouring or handling hot liquids.

Google thermocouples to see what they are and how they function.
Google Arduino projects and look for thermocouple examples.
Apply what you learned from last class
Design and carry out an experiment to determine the response time of your dial thermometer
Design and carry out an experiment to determine the accuracy of your dial thermometer
Estimate the user error of your dial thermometer
Take a section of type K thermocouple wire from the supply box. Strip the ends and make it into a thermocouple by twisting the exposed wires on one end together.  The other ends will be connected to the Arduino. 
Program the Arduino to take the voltage measurements and complete your functioning thermocouple.
Discussion with group members: design a protocol to calibrate your new temperature measurement device. Decide on an appropriate number of samples.  Write this down and make sure to include this protocol in your report. 
After lab, perform a statistical analysis to determine if the slope of the calibration curve is significant. Discuss the result in your report.
After lab go to: http://srdata.nist.gov/its90/download/type_k.tab (Links to an external site.). Plot the NIST curve on top of your calibration.  How do your calibrations compare to the national standard? Discuss any differences and their potential causes.
